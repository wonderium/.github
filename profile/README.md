**Wonderium.dev** is an interactive learning platform for frontend developers.\
Our mission is to make web development studying more practical and understandable.

So far, we have created the following levels for both practice and learning:
[HTML](https://wonderium.dev/html), [CSS](https://wonderium.dev/css), [JavaScript](https://wonderium.dev/js), [Accessibility](https://wonderium.dev/a11y).\
New levels are already on the way!

This is an open project and [contributions](https://github.com/wonderium/content/blob/main/contributing.md) to our content [repository](https://github.com/wonderium/content) are ðŸ¤— welcome from everyone.
